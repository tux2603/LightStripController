When submitting new images to the repo, please add them to the 
[images](https://github.com/tux2603/LightStripController/tree/images "You found the mouse-over text! Good for you!") branch.
This is done in an attempt to separate actual development work from 'cosmetic' type changes. The images branch will 
be periodically reviewed and merged into/re-based onto the master branch when the need arises.
