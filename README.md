lightStrip

The set-up for this project is as follow:
 * A Raspberry Pi with some sort of graphical display capabilities (at least 480 by 320 pixels)
 * An Arduino hooked up to the rPi via USB
 * Two 150-NeoPixel light strips hooked up to the Arduino via PWM
 * All the power supplies and random wires this setup entails
 
As such, the project is not designed to work on Windows<sup>™©®☣§℠℗</sup>, nor are there any plans to port it to Windows<sup>™©®☣§℠℗</sup> in the foreseeable future.
Please do not expect it to work with Windows<sup>™©®☣§℠℗</sup>.

My hands are typing words!

Ryan doesn't trust me.
